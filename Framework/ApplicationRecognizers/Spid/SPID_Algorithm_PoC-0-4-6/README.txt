SPID Algorithm Proof-of-Concept, copyright Erik Hjelmvik 2009-2010

The SPID Algorithm and SPID Proof-of-Concept source code is available
for free (as in beer) given that the license conditions described in
LICENSE-SPID.txt are met.

The SPID algorithm would probably never have seen the light of the
Internet if it wouldn't have been for .SE (The Internet Infrastructure
Foundation). .SE have provided funding for the research performed by
Erik Hjelmvik and kindly helped finding good ways to communicate the
idea and results from the project to the world.
